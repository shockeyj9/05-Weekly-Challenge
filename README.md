# Work Day Scheduler | 05 Weekly Challenge

## Description

This application is used to record tasks and their respective time-slots for time management. Each hour on the schedule is designed to change colors by comparing the time slot to the current hour and reflect the following colors:
    * Past time slots are indicated in grey
    * Current hour is indicated in red
    * Future time slots are indicated in green

Once the task has been entered the save button on the left hand side can be clicked to save the task to local storage. This functionality allows users to navigate away from the page, and once they return, the tasks are rendered to the page and are available to be edited.

During the process of this assignment I learned how to work with jQuery and Dayjs third party APIs.

## Usage

This application uses styling to update the hour time slots. 
Past times reflect a background color of grey:

![past-hour](./Assets)

The current hour reflects a background color of red:

Future times reflect a background color of green:

![future-hours](./Assets)

After the user enters a task, or deletes the current task, the save button is clicked:

![save-feature](./Assets)

The user can then navigate away from the application, or refresh the application, and the tasks will be rendered to the page:
